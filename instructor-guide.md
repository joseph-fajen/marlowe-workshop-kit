# Instructor guide

Before starting the work to deliver the workshop/hackathon, review all the content of the [Hackathon Starter Kit](https://github.com/input-output-hk/education/blob/main/hackatons/organization-guide.md.html).

The challenge is to go from a prompt (explanation of what the contract should do in natural language) to a contract deployed in the Preview testnet.

## Flow of the workshop/hackathon

1. The workshop starts with an explanation of what Cardano, smart contracts, and Marlowe are (see README's outline).
1. Then, one of the instructors showcases the steps to go from prompt to deployed contract. 
1. Then, the challengers try to go from prompt to deployed smart contract for a contract of similar difficulty (easy).
1. If there's enough time, the instructors introduce another (slightly harder) prompt.
1. Keep repeating the previous step with harder and harder prompts until you run out of time. [These are the prompts -> contracts](). It's preferable to use them in that order.
1. Congratulate everyone, and if there's a prize, give it to the person/s who completed the most smart contracts (Or the one that finished first if you run out of challenges before the deadline).
